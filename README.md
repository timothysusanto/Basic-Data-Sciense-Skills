Feature engineering is an essential part of building any intelligent system. Even though you have a lot of newer methodologies coming in like deep learning and meta-heuristics which aid in automated machine learning, each problem is domain specific and better features (suited to the problem) is often the deciding factor of the performance of your system. Feature Engineering is an art as well as a science and this is the reason Data Scientists often spend 70% of their time in the data preparation phase before modeling. Let’s look at a few quotes relevant to feature engineering from several renowned people in the world of Data Science.

“Coming up with features is difficult, time-consuming, requires expert knowledge. ‘Applied machine learning’ is basically feature engineering.”* — Prof. Andrew Ng.
This basically reinforces what we mentioned earlier about data scientists spending close to 80% of their time in engineering features which is a difficult and time-consuming process, requiring both domain knowledge and mathematical computations.

“Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.” — Dr. Jason Brownlee
This gives us an idea about feature engineering being the process of transforming data into features to act as inputs for machine learning models such that good quality features help in improving the overall model performance. Features are also very much dependent on the underlying problem. Thus, even though the machine learning task might be same in different scenarios, like classification of emails into spam and non-spam or classifying handwritten digits, the features extracted in each scenario will be very different from the other.

Prof. Pedro Domingos from the University of Washington, in his paper titled, “A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning” tells us the following.

“At the end of the day, some machine learning projects succeed and some fail. What makes the difference? Easily the most important factor is the features used.” — Prof. Pedro Domingos
The final quote which should motivate you about feature engineering is from renowned Kaggler, Xavier Conort. Most of you already know that tough real-world machine learning problems are often posted on Kaggle regularly which is usually open to everyone.

“The algorithms we used are very standard for Kagglers. …We spent most of our efforts in feature engineering. … We were also very careful to discard features likely to expose us to the risk of over-fitting our model.” — Xavier Conort
